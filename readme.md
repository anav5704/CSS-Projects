![hero](https://github.com/anav5704/CSS-Projects/blob/main/docs/css-projects.png)

This is a simple collection of CSS projects that I made when I was learning CSS that beginners can learn from. There are 9 projects in total, each with 3 levels of difficulty. The simple way to make it, the funny way to make it, and the overkill way to make it. Live demos can be found on my Instagram account(you might have to scroll quite a bit).

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS

## Getting Started

Make sure you have the ```live server``` extension installed in VS Code. Then fork and clone the repo. Once cloned, just fire up the live server and enjoy.
